                    <h1> How can I support someone in this crisis?</h1>
                    <p> Bringing up a certain topic you know someone is struggling about is definitely not an easy task. In order to ask someone about anything they're struggling with, you must be mentally prepared yourself and take a calm approach.</p>
                    <p>Set time aside and make sure there are no distractions that might surround you. The conversation you should have with the person should be open and non-judgemental. You should listen carefully to what they have to say and let them share as little or much as they'd like to.
                    </p>
                    <p> Make sure you understand your limits on the support you can provide.
